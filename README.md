# Fake Shop (Only in Russian)
This project was created by me as a demonstration of the work of fake stores in Telegram. In the bot, you can configure all the buttons (for receiving responses), send a newsletter, change the settings and the name of the store.

Before setting up the store itself, you must specify the bot token and the administrator id. Developments in this area will no longer be carried out. This is the final version of the project.

After performing my research, the result showed that the creation of such stores is very simple in execution and does not carry any difficulties. Using my bot as an example, you can clearly see how fake stores, bots selling illegal substances, and many other projects in this area work.

> Attention! This project does not encourage the use of such programs. It was created for the purpose of obtaining information in the field of information security and as a clear example of the use of programming languages for bad purposes.
